1) Character Generation / Image generation
Ans:                                     THE CHARACTER GENERATOR ROM
     Character generator adds character or animated text to video in video editing. It is based on hardware and software.
     Most computers today use a special device called a character generator ROM to convert the ASCII bytes to a tiny dot matrix pattern for displaying on the tv screen.
     This dot matrix can have a density ranging from 5×7 (the most coarse and not allowing lowercase) to 10×12 (the most dense and allowing all symbols of the alphabet).
     As the resolution of the dot matrix of the character increases so does the cost of the ROM chip; so, the 5×7 and 7×9 matrixes have become popular, the 7×9 . 
     2-4B having uppercase, lowercase, and Greek math symbols.
     Besides cost, another factor that limits the character matrix density is maximum dot frequency permitted by the tv.
     This simply means that the internal circuits of the television set will not allow a dot pattern to be resolved if there are frequency components in it which exceed 
     about 6 MH.
     The purpose of the character generator ROM is to accept the ASCII bytes from memory and convert them to a row of dots for the character that these bytes represent.
     The secret to understanding how the video circuits work is to realize that the ROM puts out all the dots for one row of all the characters on a single line of text
     on the screen (which might be 25 to 80 characters long.
     This is shown in above fig. In this figure the top row of dots of all characters on the first line are being displayed. Each row here takes 63 μs. Characters in a
     line are presented to the ROM eight times, once for each row.
     Thus, each character on a line of text is accessed from screen memory several times until all the rows are laid down.
     If the characters are on a 5×7 matrix then each character is accessed seven times, one time for each of the seven rows.
     The more rows in the character matrix, the better and faster the video circuits must be.

2) Explain the working of LCD.
Ans:                                        LCD Monitors
    Liquid crystal display technology works by blocking light. Specifically, an LCD is made of two pieces of polarized glass (also called substrate) that contain a liquid
    crystal material between them.A backlight creates light that passes through the first substrate. At the same time, electrical currents cause the liquid crystal
    molecules to align to allow varying levels of light to pass through to the second substrate and create the colors and images that you see.
    
                                           The Basics of LCD Displays
    While there are several different configurations for LCD displays, most are designed in the same basic manner.While there are several different configurations for LCD
    displays, most are designed in the same basic manner.When the backlight is activated, it produces light that is somewhat obstructed by the liquid crystals. And this
    obstruction is essentially what creates the images we see in LCD displays.Of course, a backlight is an essential component of an LCD display. Without a backlight, an
    LCD display wouldn’t be able to produce the visible images. Some of the most common types of backlights used in LCD displays include the following:
     a.Cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL)
     b.EL-WLED array
     c.WLED array
     d.RGB-LED array
                                       Benefits of LCD Displays
     There are several benefits associated with LCD displays, one of which is the simple fact that they do not suffer from image burn-in. Commonly found in other electronic
     displays, image burn-in is a phenomenon that occurs when the image remains in the display after it has been changed. If the user pauses or otherwise leaves the image
     on the screen for a long period of time, it may become “burned into” the display. Thankfully, this isn’t a problem with LCDs, as they don’t use phosphorus compounds.
     It’s also worth mentioning that LCD displays are significantly thinner and more compact than traditional CRT monitors. This is why you see so computer monitors using 
     LCD technology instead of the now-dated CRT technology. Furthermore, LCD displays offer a sharp image resolution with no bleeding, assuming they are operated at 
     native resolution. Finally, LCDs aren’t affected by the Earth’s magnetic field, which is something that cannot be said about other electronic displays. These are just
     a few reasons why LCD displays are preferred over other display types.

3) What is Firmware.Discuss
 Ans:                               Firmware
     Firmware is a software program or set of instructions programmed on a hardware device. It provides the necessary instructions for how the device communicates with the
     other computer hardware. But how can software be programmed onto hardware? Good question. Firmware is typically stored in the flash ROM of a hardware device. While
     ROM is "read-only memory," flash ROM can be erased and rewritten because it is actually a type of flash memory.
     Firmware can be thought of as "semi-permanent" since it remains the same unless it is updated by a firmware updater. You may need to update the firmware of certain
     devices, such as hard drives and video cards in order for them to work with a new operating system. CD and DVD drive manufacturers often make firmware updates available
     that allow the drives to read faster media. Sometimes manufacturers release firmware updates that simply make their devices work more efficiently.
     You can usually find firmware updates by going to the "Support" or "Downloads" area of a manufacturer's website. Keeping your firmware up-to-date is often not necessary,
     but it is still a good idea. Just make sure that once you start a firmware updater, you let the update finish, because most devices will not function if their firmware 
     is not recognized.
                                  Examples
     Examples of firmware include:

      a.The BIOS found in IBM-compatible Personal Computers
      b.Code inside a printer (in addition to the printer driver that is on the computer)
      c.Software controlling a heart defibrillator
      d.Software controlling the lights in an office building
      e.Software controlling electronics in a car — the radio, the ABS (anti-lock braking system), engine controls, etc.
      f.Software controlling newer household appliances (microwave ovens, dishwashers, etc.)

  5) Discuss different Levels of  Computer language
   Ans:                                   levels of computer languages
             Low level languages – • These languages provide nothing other than access to the machine’s basic instruction set.
                    • Example: Assembly language
             Middle level languages –
                    • These languages don’t provide all the built-in functions found in high level languages, but provide all building
                       blocks that we need to produce the result we want.
                    • Example: C, C++
             High level languages – • These level languages provide almost everything that the programmer might need to do as already 
              build into the language.
                    • Example: Java, Python
             Base on the view of a programmer.
